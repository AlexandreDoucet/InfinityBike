This is the first iteration of a custom PCB for the Infinity bike project.

It has been tested and it works, but some improvement are planned for the next iteration:

-The holes on the PCB are systematically too small.
-We will design places for a few buttons. The main purpose of these buttons would be to enable an in game calibration sequence to make sure the steering behaves as expected.
-The design needs some mounting holes.
-The spacing between the JST connectors needs to be increased.
