# Infinity Bike

Welcome to the Infinity Bike repository. A simple and inexpensive indoors bike training video game with built-in sensors that allows the player to ride on a virtual track.

# Why use Infinity Bike? 

Rainy days and the Winter season can really disrupt a training program. Riders always have the option to mount their bike on a trainer but the monotomy of trainers
will always make it a bit difficult to keep up the pace. This is why we decided to add a little bit on interactivity to our training program. The Infinity Bike set-up 
allows a rider to read the speed and steering from a bike mounted on any trainers and relay the information to the computer. Infinity Bike is designed to be as simple and
inexpensive as possible.
